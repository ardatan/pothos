# Context object

The GraphQL context object can be used to give every resolver in the schema access to some shared
state for the current request. One common use case is to store the current User on the context
object.

One important thing to note about Pothos is that every request is assumed to have a new unique
context object, so be sure to set up your context objects in a way that they are unique to each
request.

First let's define a User class that holds information about a user, and create a SchemaBuilder with
a Context type that has a currentUser property.

```typescript
class User {
  id: string;
  firstName: string;
  username: string;

  constructor(id: string, firstName: string, username: string) {
    this.id = id;
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.username = username;
  }
}

const builder = new SchemaBuilder<{
  Context: {
    currentUser: User;
  };
}>({});
```

Next, we will want to add something in our schema that uses the current user:

```typescript
builder.queryType({
  fields: (t) => ({
    currentUser: t.field({
      type: User,
      resolve: (root, args, context) => context.currentUser,
    }),
  }),
});

builder.objectType(User, {
  fields: (t) => ({
    id: t.exposeID('id', {}),
    firstName: t.exposeString('firstName', {}),
    username: t.exposeString('username', {}),
  }),
});
```

Finally, we need to actually create our context when a request is created.

```typescript
const yoga = createYoga({
  schema,
  context: async ({ req }) => ({
    // This part is up to you!
    currentUser: await getUserFromAuthHeader(req.headers.authorization),
  }),
});
const server = createServer(yoga);

server.listen(3000);
```

## Initialize context cache

Several Pothos plugins use the context object to cache data for the current request. Some examples
include dataloaders and auth scopes. This caching mechanism works based on the assumption that the
same context object is passed to every resolver in a request, and each request has a unique context
object. This works for most applications without any additional configuration.

In some rare edge cases, you may have some additional logic added to your application that clones or
mutates the context object throughout the execution of a request. To ensure that all plugins work
correctly even if the context object is cloned, wrapped, or modified in a way that does not preserve
its identity, you can manually initialize the context cache and attach it to the context object:

```typescript
import { initContextCache } from '@pothos/core';

const server = createYoga({
  schema: builder.toSchema(),
  context: async ({ req }) => ({
    // Adding this will prevent any issues if you server implementation
    // copies or extends the context object before passing it to your resolvers
    ...initContextCache(),

    currentUser: await getUserFromAuthHeader(req.headers.authorization),
  }),
});

const server = createServer(yoga);

server.listen(3000);
```
